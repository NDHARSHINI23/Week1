# Week1
Improved waste classification accuracy using data augmentation and model tuning. Developed a Streamlit web app for real-time image upload and prediction with confidence scores. Enhanced dataset quality and added eco-friendly disposal tips to promote sustainable recycling practices.

PROJECT TITLE:WASTE CLASSIFICATION FOR SMART RECYCLING

PROJECT PROBLEM STATEMENT: Improper waste segregation leads to pollution and inefficient recycling. To support sustainability, an image-based system can help classify waste automatically into categories like plastic, paper, metal, and organic using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

PROJECT GOAL: Build a CNN model that can take an image of waste and classify it into the correct category, promoting smart recycling and sustainable waste management.

CONCEPTS USED: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): for image recognition. Deep Learning: part of AI that helps computers learn from images. Sustainability: helps reduce pollution by sorting waste properly.

DATASET:Waste Classification Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data It contains labeled images of: Plastic, Paper, Metal, Glass, Organic waste
